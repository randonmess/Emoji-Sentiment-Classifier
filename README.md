# Emoji-Sentiment-Classifier
Using TF Keras to implement a basic RNN and LSTM model to return a emoji sentiment for a given sentence.

## Objectives
* Create an embedding layer in Keras with pre-trained word vectors
* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm
* Build a sentiment classifier using word embeddings
* Build and train a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM

## Results
- The basic RNN model acheives a 91% accuracy score from 127 training examples for 100 epochs
- The LSTM model acheives an 89% accuracy score from 127 training examples for 50 epochs
